Abstract:
The Faculty Management System is an online application designed to streamline interactions between faculty and students.
Admins can manage user accounts, while faculty can schedule classes, upload marks, and handle professional responsibilities.
Students can view their grades and lecture schedules.
By incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, the system enhances communication, allowing users to easily search for information and receive personalized notifications.
This project aims to improve efficiency and engagement in educational environments. Overall, it provides a centralized platform for academic management.
